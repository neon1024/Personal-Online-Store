# 🛍️ Personal Online Store

A full‑stack e‑commerce application that serves as a personal online store. Users can browse products, manage shopping carts, and complete purchases, while administrators have a dedicated dashboard to manage products, upload images, and oversee the platform.

Product images are securely uploaded to Cloudinary, and all data is handled via backend RESTful APIs, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready architecture.

Built with modern technologies and best practices, this project demonstrates clean architecture, role-based access control, API-first development, and realistic business logic.

## 💡 Project Overview

The Personal Online Store is designed to replicate core features found in professional e-commerce platforms:

Browsing catalog of products

User authentication and session-managed shopping cart

Backend APIs serving frontend UI

Persistent database with relational modeling

Clean separation of concerns between client and server

The codebase illustrates how a real production system should be structured — not just a quick demo or tutorial clone.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control & Admin Dashboard

Secure registration and login flows, fully managed by backend APIs.

Clear separation of user roles. Administrators have a dedicated dashboard to manage products, perform CRUD operations, and oversee the platform.

### 🖼️ Cloud-Based Product Management

Admins can upload product images securely to Cloudinary, ensuring scalable and reliable media handling.

### 🛒 Product Catalog & Shopping Experience

Users can browse products through an intuitive, responsive UI, manage their cart, and simulate checkout actions.

### 🔁 API-First Architecture

Frontend communicates exclusively with backend RESTful APIs for all data and state management.

### 📊 Persistent Relational Database

All product, user, and order data is stored in PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
